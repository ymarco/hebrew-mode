#+TITLE: hebrew-mode: Sane Hebrew defaults in emacs
#+DATE: February 9, 2020

This minor mode provides easy configuration of Hebrew, with saner defaults and
optional spell checking.

Note that buffers with ~hebrew-mode~ enabled in them don't have to be /all/ Hebrew.

All of the variables and functions have a ~hebrew-~ prefix; you can read search
for them and read the docs straight inside Emacs.
