#+TITLE: hebrew-mode: saner Hebrew defaults for Emacs
#+DATE: February 9, 2020

This minor mode sets basic Hebrew stuff for buffers using Hebrew:
 - Font
 - BiDi paragraphs
 - Input method
 - Spell checking


*Usage:* ~M-x hebrew-mode~. This doesn't set the Hebrew input method immediately,
you should do that when you want with ~toggle-input-method~, (defaultly bound by
Emacs to ~C-\~). Explicitly set input methods with
~hebrew-set-hebrew-input-method~ or ~hebrew-set-regular-input-method~.

Buffers with ~hebrew-mode~ enabled in them don't have to be /all/ Hebrew, this mode
just sets nicer things for Hebrew.
