#+TITLE: hebrew-mode: saner defaults for Hebrew in Emacs
#+DATE: February 9, 2020

This minor mode provides easy configuration of Hebrew, with saner defaults and
optional spell checking.

Usage: ~M-x hebrew-mode <RET>~

Note that buffers with ~hebrew-mode~ enabled in them don't have to be /all/ Hebrew.

All of the variables and functions have a ~hebrew-~ prefix; you can search for
them and read the docs straight inside Emacs.
